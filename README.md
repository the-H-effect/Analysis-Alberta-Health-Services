## Insight 1: Primary Care Network (PCN)
### AHS Zone: Calgary
1. Although Calgary West Central had the highest number of Primary Care Network (PCN) providers (4,800), Calgary Foothills had the highest total number of patients enrolled, with the numbers standing at a little above 4 million patients. 
2. Calgary Foothills received highest total payments made to PCN at $0.23 billion. 
3. For AHS Zone xxx (Calgary), the total Number of patients enrolled has been on a steady increase from 2012 till 2021. And although payments received initially showed same increase, there is a noticeable dip between 2015 and 2016, where payments dropped even though there was continous increase in patients enrolled.

### Year 2021
I was surprised to see that Organic dementia was a higher contributor to 2021 deaths in Alberta (19%), than the Covid-19 virus (17%). To be honest I had no idea prior to this analysis what Organic dementia was, and this surprising insight that it was a leading cause of death spurred me into doing some research on this disease.
